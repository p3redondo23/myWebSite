     <p> Leonel Messi is a hero I look up to. He is a proffesional soccer player for the spanish team barcelona. His story started when he was born in Argentina. He rapidly became really good at soccer when he decided to want to take soccer. I became a really big fan of his and then for my 10th birthday I got a shirt that was signed by him which was super cool.

    <p> Messi is in the team barcelona they are a soccer team and have a really big rivalery between Real Madrid. In my opinion Barcelona is the better soccer team but there is other people that think real madrid is better. Both my parents and my brother are fans of Real Madrid but I am not so every time they both have a big game we argue on who we think is going to win.
